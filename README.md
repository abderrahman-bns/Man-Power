ManPower is one of the world leaders in temporary work. It meets all recruitment needs for fixed-term contracts, permanent contracts, work-study contracts and permanent employment contracts. Thus, it offers companies a service that consists in finding the qualified personnel they are looking for and job seekers targeted OFFERS. CANDIDATES and companies must register beforehand and pay an annual fee. You are required to create a file to manage CANDIDATES and their CVs. A CV must specify at least one area of specialization in addition to the candidate's references: a unique code, first and last name, address, etc. You are also asked to keep track of all the job offers made by companies. Each offer is known by: a code, and is valid from a date (day, month, year), until it is taken. Each offer maintains a list of potential candidates classified by order of merit. The model to be implemented will contain structures, whose fields contain a minimum of information as below. It will be necessary to be able to save the data of these structures in files.
